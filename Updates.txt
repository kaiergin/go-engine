Tested in Golang 1.2.1 on Linux Mint

5/26/2016:
First engine build. Includes engine with working random bot.
Time still not added.
Engine is essentially built for building AI.
Engine does not know how to handle two AIs at the moment.
Possible bugs.

Please screenshot any bugs found while using so I can fix them!

To Do:
- Debug (obviously)
	- Possible bugs due to Ko
	- Possible bugs in end game (counting points)
- Install Golang on linux server
- Add time
- Add options for displaying things (points, coordinate system, etc.)
- Add end game counting points (in progress)
- Add error return for illegal moves
- Add in striking system for illegal moves
- Write JavaScript/HTML for Go GUI to be displayed on server
	- Will include uploading/updating AI
	- Will include playback of previous AI games
	- Will include a leaderboard for current top AI

5/27/2016:
- Added options
- Added timing
- Added striking system
- End gaming counting finished but dead chains still break counting territory
- Nothing has been tested so bugs almost definitely exist
- Golang is not able to be installed on the linux server!
- Looking for an alternative way to have AI compete

To Do:
- Add a debugging mode to debug engine functions
- This help fix bugs in end game counting and ensure Ko is working properly

	- What turn is it? (1st, 2nd, 3rdâ€¦)
